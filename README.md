# Getting Started

1. `npm install` to get all dependencies
2. `npm run dev` to build JS and start dev server (default port 8080)

# Deps

You'll have to install these manually since some of us don't know how to write a build system. Luckily, you can install them all in one fell swoop with `npm install -g <packages>`.

These all require node and npm.

1. browserify
2. lessc
3. clean-css
4. reactify
5. watchify
6. uglifyjs
7. http-server
